## Midterm 1 - Assignment 5 (march 2020)
### Image processing with SIFT algorithm

- Select one image from each of the eight thematic subsets (see previous assignment), for a total of 8 images.
- Extract the SIFT descriptors for the 8 images using the visual feature detector embedded in SIFT to identify the
points of interest. 
- Show the resulting points of interest overlapped on the image. 
- Then provide a confrontation between two SIFT descriptors showing completely different information 
(e.g. a SIFT descriptor from a face portion Vs a SIFT descriptor from a tree image). 
- The confrontation can be simply visual: for instance you can plot the two IFT descriptors closeby as barplots 
(remember that SIFTs are histograms). But you are free to pick-up any
reasonable means of confronting the descriptors (even quantitatively, if you whish).
